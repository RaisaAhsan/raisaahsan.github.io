    <h1>CLAIM</h1>
    <p>The mystery box contains a complex tubing system connected to separate containers inside rather than a straight tube connecting the entrance funnel to the exit tube.</p>
    
    <h1>EVIDENCE</h1>
    <p>The mystery box is a black box that has a funnel at the top where liquids are poured in, and a tube at the bottom where liquids appear out of. During our first few trials, we observed that the volume of liquid going in wasn’t the same as the volume coming out. Our approach to this problem was to recreate the mystery box and use water & oil to test why different quantities of liquid appeared out of the box and whether the substances were going elsewhere. Our model specifically included curved and looped tubes connected to separate containers which were then hooked up to the exit tube to create a complex tubing system. The substances enter the container at a low point but exit the container into another tube at a high point, so when you tip the box or store several trials’ worth of liquids inside, more or less liquid comes out but the volume is never the same as the initial quantity. After recreating the box, we poured specific measurements of oil and water into the funnel and measured the collected substances at the end. We also tested how much volume was leaving the box when we tipped it forward. During trial #1, we poured in 500 ml of water & 200 ml of oil but received 315 ml of water and 55 ml of oil out of the exit tube. During trial #3, we poured in another 500 ml of water & no oil but received 100 ml of water & 50 ml of oil out when the box was tipped forward. The following trials had a consistent pattern of pouring volumes of liquid in and measuring a different quantity of liquid when it comes out. </p>
    
    <h1>REASONING</h1>
    <h3>Part #1-</h3>
    <p>Models are visual representations of concepts, ideas, and structures. They can be useful when explaining complex ideas and showing others your perspective on things. And although they’re helpful, they also limit the number of ideas you can show at a time. Most models are meant to show either 1 or 2 perspectives of an idea or topic, it’s not possible to include *all* details. Models can be both intricate and simple despite the fact that they are meant to make understanding ideas easier. However, too much activity occurring might end in a failed model.</p>
    <h3>Part #2-</h3>
    <p>Our datasets tell us that the amount of liquid going in is not the same as what is coming out, we know that there must be more complex structures inside the mystery box. There have to be separate containers in the interior to collect the liquid that doesn’t make it out, otherwise, the substances would just leak out of the bottom. When we tested a replica of the mystery box with a separate container inside connecting to other tubes, the substance pressure and exiting substance volume increased when the box was tipped forward, exactly like how the original mystery box did during our very first experiments. To claim the tubing connecting the funnel and exit tube is a simple, straight tube would be incorrect because based on both datasets -one testing water with the class, and the other testing water & oil with my group- some of the volume being poured in doesn’t end up out of the box. Plus, the water pressure is not consistent unless you add lots of water, meaning the tubing is looped or curved at the least. All of these theories and claims are perfectly reasonable and are possible answers to the mystery of the mystery box. </p>
    <h3>Part #3</h3>
    <p>One might claim that the mystery box is built with a singular straight tube connecting the funnel to the exit tube with no added pathways or containers on the inside. But we know this is untrue because during our first class-wide dataset, trial #1 was measured to have 500 ml of water poured in but no water came out. This tells us that the water must’ve gone down a different tube and ended up somewhere else. This observation further proves my claim about the mystery box being built with a curved and looped tubing system & extra interior containers. </p>
